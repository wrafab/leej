<h1>Week 1: Creating my webpage</h1>
	<p>
	<h2> In our first Digital Engineering & Fabrication class, we learned the basics of creating a webpage using HTML. We used GitHub 
	to customize our pages, which will later be updated as we complete future projects. I had a bit of difficulty with the coding at
	first, but I started to get the hang of it after looking at other page sources and finding information online. This page is where
	I will post reflections, images, and files of my creations. </h2>
