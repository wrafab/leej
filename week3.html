<h1>Week 3: Garment Design & Sublimation Printing</h1>
</html>
 <br>
	<p>
	<h2> Using Photoshop, I created a magazine cover design for my shirt. I found a photo of a celebrity, cut him out, and placed it
	next to a photo of me. I then refined the edges and tones so the manipulation would look more natural, then found a magazine cover
	and replaced the cover photo with my newly created image. I then headed over to print my design using the Brother printer.
		I steam-pressed the shirt beforehand to remove wrinkles, and again after printing to ensure that the ink would set.</h2>
	<br>
	For my sublimation printing project, I took two photos and pasted them onto a template for a mug in CorelDraw. I then flipped and printed
	the design, cut it out, taped it onto my mug, and used a heat press to transfer the design onto the mug. After removing the mug from the
	heat press, I had to submerge it in water to cool it down.
	<br>
	Both of these processes were super interesting and it was exciting being able to create customized products. I would definitely use these
	machines again in the future once I come up with more design ideas.
