<h1>Week 2: Fusion 360</h1>
	  <br>
	<p>
	<h2> This week, we created personalized stamps using a program called Fusion 360. I had missed a few classes, so I watched an example video 
 and figured out how to use the program. I created a stamp that has my initials JL in cursive, and played around with the different tools in
	  Fusion 360 to add decorative elements to the body of my stamp. Making the model was really fun and the program was easy to use.
	  After designing the stamp, I sent the file to the 3D printer. I'm pretty happy with how my stamp turned out!</h2>
